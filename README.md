RHOCI Dashboard (Red Hat OpenStack CI)

A dashboard with the goal of enhancing user experience in everything related to inspect CI/CD results

* Quickly filter jobs by build result, product release, compose ID, etc.
* Search for pipelines with certain characteristics (e.g. network backend, storage type, etc.)
* Quickly list all the jobs where a certain test fails

And more :D
